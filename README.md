### Getting Started ðŸš€

npm:
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run serve
```
yarn:
```sh
yarn
yarn dev
yarn build
yarn serve
```

### Develop with Docker
To have consistent environment it is good to already use docker straight away
in development.

To do so just build the image:
```
docker build --tag mydev .
```
and run with:
```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /home/node/app/node_modules -v $PWD:/home/node/app mydev
```
